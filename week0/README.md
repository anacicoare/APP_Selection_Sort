## Project Description

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from an unsorted section of a list and placing it at the correct position of the sorted section.

This algorithm is applied on matrix rows representing students' grades for each school subject.

## Time & Space complexity

- Time complexity: O(n^3)
- Space complexity: O(1)
